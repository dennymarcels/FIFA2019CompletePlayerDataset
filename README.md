# FIFA 2019 Complete Player Dataset

This notebook works around a dataset containing 90 attributes of 18.2k+ soccer players registered in the latest edition (2019) of the FIFA database. It was made available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19). The user who made it available used a own-developed scrapper to get the information from [FIFA's website](https://sofifa.com/players).

I will use the technical features contained in this dataset, and also the athletes' weight and height, to group them in technical profiles, and then I will investigate the relationships between these profiles and their assigned field position.
